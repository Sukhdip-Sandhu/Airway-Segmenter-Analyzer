# Airway Segmenter & Analyzer

##### In continual efforts to understand chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), researchers spend a great deal of time working with microCT scans of lung cores. Currently, there are no fully developed programs available that enable researchers to gain quantitative data of lung airways given a microCT scan. A single program is required for researchers to get the data they need and for this reason, Airway Segmenter & Analyzer (ASA) was developed.
